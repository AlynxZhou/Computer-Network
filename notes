TDM     time-division multiplexing
PoPs    points of presence:A PoP is simply a group of one or more routers (at the same location) in the providerâ€™s network where customer ISPs can connect into the provider ISP.
IXP     Internet Exchange Point
DoS attacks     denial-of-servece attack:As the name suggests, a DoS attack renders a network, host, or other piece of infrastructure unusable by legitimate users.

ARQ     Automatic Repeat reQuest : In communication, receiver user positive3 ack or negative ack to let sender know whether the message is received correct or wrong. We call reliable data transfer protocols based on such retransmission ARQ protocols.
GBN     Go-Back-N:the sender is allowed to transmit multiple packets (when available) without waiting for an acknowledgment, but is constrained to have no more than some maximum allowable number, N, of unacknowledged packets in the pipeline.
SR      Selective Repeat


Termiology
packet switches :
    Between source and destination, each packet travels through them.There are two predominant types, routers and linklayer switches
circuit-switched networks :
    In circuit-switched networks, the resources needed along a path (buffers, link
    transmission rate) to provide for communication between the end systems are
    reserved for the duration of the communication session between the end systems.
segment         : transport layer packket
datagram        : network-layer packet
transport-layer multiplexing and demultiplexing     : UDP and TCP extend host-to-host delivery to process-to-process delivery

LEO     low-earth orbiting
FDM     frequency-division multiplexing: one of the way that a circuit in a link implenmented
TDM     time-division multiplexing
PoPs    points of presence:A PoP is simply a group of one or more routers (at the same location) in the provider’s network where customer ISPs can connect into the provider ISP.
IXP     Internet Exchange Point
DoS attacks     denial-of-servece attack:As the name suggests, a DoS attack renders a network, host, or other piece of infrastructure unusable by legitimate users.
DDos    distributed DoS
SSL     secure socket layer: an enhancement for TCP, for improvement of security
HTTP    HyperText Transfer Protocol
RTT     round-trip time:the time it takes for a small packet to travel from client to server and then back to the client.
POP    Post Office Protocol: a kind of mail access protocol
IMAP    Internet Mail Access Protocol : as above

FSM     finite-stare machine
ARQ     Automatic Repeat reQuest : In communication, receiver user positive3 ack or negative ack to let sender know whether the message is received correct or wrong. We call reliable data transfer protocols based on such retransmission ARQ protocols.
GBN     Go-Back-N:the sender is allowed to transmit multiple packets (when available) without waiting for an acknowledgment, but is constrained to have no more than some maximum allowable number, N, of unacknowledged packets in the pipeline.
SR      Selective Repeat
MSS     maximum segment size: the maximum segment size can be grabbed and placed in a TCP  buffered data segment.Note that MSS is the maximum amount of application-layer data in the segment.
MTU     maximum transmission unit:largest link-layer frame that can be sent by the local sending host.

Termiology
packet switches :
    Between source and destination, each packet travels through them.There are two predominant types, routers and linklayer switches
circuit-switched networks :
    In circuit-switched networks, the resources needed along a path (buffers, link
    transmission rate) to provide for communication between the end systems are
    reserved for the duration of the communication session between the end systems.
segment         : transport layer packket
datagram        : network-layer packet
transport-layer multiplexing and demultiplexing     : UDP and TCP extend host-to-host delivery to process-to-process delivery
TCP segments    : each chunk of client data with a TCP header.
forwarding and routing functions of the network layer: Forwarding involves the transfer of a packet from an incoming link to an outgoing link within a single router. Routing involves all of a network’s routers, whose collective interactions via routing protocols determine the paths that packets take on their trips from source to destination node.
virtual-cirtuit network : Computer networks that provide only a connection service at the network layer are called virtual-circuit (VC) networks.
datagram network :Computer networks that provide only a connectionless service at the network layer are called datagram networks.
